To investigate how soil carbon can be predicted using canopy structure metrics, this study adressed the following research questions:
(1) How does the predictive accuracy of  soil carbon models change with different levels of data availability?  
(2) What can we infer about the mechanistic relationships between key predictors and soil carbon?

We selected 142 locations for soil sampling (Figure 1), that were within the footprints sampled by the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) sensor and within the airborne lidar coverage. These locations were stratified to sample different forest ages, degradation histories, distance from rivers, and distance to forest edge.
